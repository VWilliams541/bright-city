    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. I get carried away with this brush cleaning.</p>

<p>Let your imagination be your guide. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>

<p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. A happy cloud. There we go. Put it in, leave it alone. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.</p>

<p>Just make little strokes like that. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.</p>

<p>You can do it. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We need dark in order to show light.</p>

<p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
