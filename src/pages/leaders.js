    <h1>About Our Leaders</h1>
    <p>For years, Ike and Sharon Miller have sensed God calling them to lead together,
        and they believe God was equipping them specifically for Raleigh-Durham. In addition to their years of ministry experience, 
        both earned Master of Divinity degrees from Duke Divinity School and PhDs from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. 
        Together, they have a passion for making the deep things of faith accessible to everyone, no matter where they are in their faith.
        Ike loves Duke basketball, good food, friends, and coffee. Sharon is an author and a speaker,
        with a big heart for teaching and encouraging women. She also blames Ike for her addiction to coffee. 
        They have two boys, Isaac and Coen, and they recently welcomed their first little girl, Sadie, who is in charge now.
